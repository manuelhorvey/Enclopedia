Here are the designs for the screens:

Entry Page: The main entry page is designed to highlight featured content and provide navigational links to various sections of the encyclopedia. It would typically display a featured article, news, and recent changes, with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Index Page: The index page lists all the encyclopedia entries alphabetically. It includes a sidebar for quick navigation by letter and the ability to jump to different sections of the alphabet.

Search Interface: The search interface includes a prominent search button on the header of the encyclopedia. Once a search term is entered, the results are displayed in a clear, legible format with titles, excerpts, and links to the full entries.

New Page Creation: The new page creation interface is a form-based screen allowing users to enter the title, text, and upload media for a new encyclopedia entry. The design encourages user participation and is intuitive to use.

Edit Page Interface: The edit page interface allows users to edit existing entries. It includes text fields, formatting tools, and revision history to ensure accurate and comprehensive entry updates.

Random Article Feature: The random article feature includes a button that, when clicked, takes the user to a random entry within the encyclopedia. It's designed to encourage exploration of the content.
